## Description:

The QuaFoodies application is a web based application that displays restaurant related data analysis for prospective
restaurant entrepreneurs. Our web application is written in Typescript/React on the frontend and python/flask on the
backend. The application consists of a visualization of all restaurant closings and openings during the covid-19
pandemic. The application is also interactive in that it takes input form the user and predicts restaurant survivability
given multiple factors.

The user will be presented with multiple checkboxes that they can select that correspond to the type of restaurant
and/or features of their prospective restaurant. We take the input in the form of booleans and pass that to the API
which is written in python/flask. This api serializes the data into a model that we can then run analysis on. We return
either a successful or unsuccessful prospective rating for the user. The user can then make decisions or tweak their
inputs accordingly.
